# ImageClassification
Here we are implementing Image Classification and that using simple library of Machine Learning i.e. Scikit-learn, which is very popular to solve Machine Learning Problems. It help us understand the fundamentals of Image Processing, Data training and many more thing. 

The process is mainly divided in 4 major steps:
1. Prepare the data
2. Spliting the data into training data and testing data
3. Training the classifier
4. Testing the performance

In order to train the model/Classifier we are using C-Support Vector Classification (SVC)

In order to run this project:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt 
2. run main.py file
